the increasing use of digital technology presents a challenge for existing storage capabilities  the need for a reliable and long term solution for information storage is further heightened by the prediction that the current magnetic and optical storage will become unrecoverable within a century or less  dna is a compact  long-term  and proven medium for information storag  indeed  over the last few decades  a good case has been made for crucial information storage in dna  desirable properties of dna include its capacity for long-term information storage and recovery  which are mostly independent of technological changes  the ability to conceal data in a miniaturized fashion and its ability to be transferred  when required  via self propagation  various approaches for information coding in dna have been reported  including the Huffman code  the comma code  and the alternating code  a straight coding based on three bases per letter  or sequential conversion of text to keyboard scan codes followed by conversion to hexadecimal code and then conversion to binary code with a designed nucleotide encryption key  each approach others advantages and inherent difficulties  and differs in the degree of economical use of nucleotides  We sought to develop an alternate approach for information archiving in dna  we used the principles of the huffman code to de ne dna codons for the entire keyboard  for unambiguous information coding binary space partitions are an interesting application of trees that has been used in rendering for computer graphics collision detection for mobile robots  and computer games  it was used in the doom engine   the basic idea is to recursively partition the space of interest  eg   the game field  into smaller and simpler polygons  or polyhedra  in general  until each partition is empty of objects other than on the partitioning boundaries
